I am planning to post some blogs or notes in this section, not only about academic topics but also about travel experiences and other things that impressed me.

# My grandma
I used to live very closely with my grandma, whom I usually call Popo (2nd tone in Chinese). I love her deeply, because I felt the same love I gave her—and in fact, she gave me even more love than I could return. Until my third year of middle school, my parents were away; they then came back home and began raising me. However, I still haven’t found a strong connection with them. I hope that one day I can live with my grandma again, but everyone is still struggling with their living conditions. That is why I now live far from home and cannot make my dream come true. Because of this, I want to keep some stories of my grandma (Popo) and share them with others, to show what a remarkable woman she is.
